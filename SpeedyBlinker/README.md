# SpeedyBlinker

Speedy Blinker tries to measure the period that a source of light must blink for you to recognize that it is blinking and not purely off. 

# Usage
Build the push-button and LED circuits shown in report.pdf, build the single source code and upload to your board. 

You will re-start and wait until you can see the LED blinking. At that point, press the push-button as fast as you can. Then check the output on the Serial Monitor. Finally, you can start a new test by pressing the push button again.
