# ENGR102
ENGR102 is a very introduction to electronics class offered in Washington Colleges, which might be reflected in the make-it-better projects.
In special, keep in mind the english and the low budget that was used in the development of the projects. The class uses the arduino board to introduce students to electronics.

ENGR102 is the first class I took at my college (while also taking Calculus I and English 101). 

A make-it-better report consists on taking some of the equipment that we just learned how to use and create something!

The final project is open-ended. See Pars (Party in Latin), a funny four legged robot that will dance with you all night long!
