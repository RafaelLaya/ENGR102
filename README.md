# ENGR102
ENGR102 is an introduction to electronics class. The class uses the arduino board to introduce students to electronics.

A make-it-better report consists on taking some of the equipment that we just learned how to use and create something!

The final project is open-ended. See Pars/ (Party in Latin), a funny four legged robot that will dance with you all night long! 

The order of the make-it-betters is: 

1. Speedy Blinker: Trying to measure the speed of a blinking light at which you do actually sense the blinking.

2. Discoteca: Funny random melodies will be created by a piezo buzzer, you can manually set a note with a soft-potentiometer and change the speed using a flex-sensor to make your own melodies!. These sensors make use of the Analog to Digital converter within the arduino in order to allow me to know how much you're flexing/touching. An RGB LED will glow dance to the music you create with a color mapped to a note and blinking at the speed of your melody.

3. Discoteca 2.0: An improved version of discoteca with an LCD screen displaying useful information and an array of 8 colored LEDs that will light up in a pattern.

4. Garage: A laser and photosensor systems will detect wheter an obstacle is on the way (usually a car toy) and a servo will open and close the entrance. A password (#102, as in ENGR102) has to be entered before the entrance will open. The code handles the case where the car does not move (car is stuck!) after he enters the correct password (the servo will not crush the incoming car).

5. The final project was Pars (Based on the mePed v2 Robot)

* In one of the homeworks we had to characterize one of the sensors, I chose the softpotentiometer. You can see those measurements in SoftPotReport.pdf and SoftPotExcel.xls
