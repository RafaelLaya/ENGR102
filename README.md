# ENGR102
ENGR102 is a very introductory class (which might be reflected in the make-it-better projects?) to electronics offered in Washington Colleges (Quarterly based system).

In special, keep in mind the english and the low budget that was used in the development of the projects. The class uses the arduino board to introduce students to electronics.

ENGR102 is the first class I took at my college (while also taking Calculus I and English 101). 

A make-it-better report consists on taking some of the equipment that we just learned how to use and create something!

The final project is open-ended. See Pars (Party in Latin), a funny four legged robot that will dance with you all night long! 

The order of the make-it-betters is: 

1. Speedy Blinker: Trying to measure the speed of a blinking light at which you do actually sense the blinking.

2. Discoteca: Funny random melodies will be created by a piezo buzzer, you can manually set a note with a soft-potentiometer and change the speed using a flex-sensor to make your own melodies!. An RGB LED will glow dance to the music you create with a color mapped to a note and blinking at the speed of your melodie.

3. Discoteca 2.0: An improved version of discoteca with an LCD screen displaying useful information and an array of 8 colored LEDs that will light up in a pattern (Imagine a volume bar? but with notes and dancing to the speed of the music).

4. Garage: A laser and photosensor systems will detect wheter an obstacle is on the way (usually a car) and a servo will open and close the entrance. A password (#102) has to be entered before the entrance will open. The code handles the case where the car does not move (maybe it got stuck after the entrance opened?) after he enters the correct password (the servo wont crush the car!).

And then the final project was Pars.
