# Discoteca v2.0

This improved version of Discoteca now supports display of important information through an LCD screen. The information includes the current note, the current speed level, and the frequency of the current note. This version now also features a linear array of 8 LEDs and a shift register to produce a device that dances to the rhythm of the song!

# Usage
